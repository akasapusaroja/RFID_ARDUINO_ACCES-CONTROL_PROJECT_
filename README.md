# RFID_ARDUINO_ACCES-CONTROL_PROJECT_
This project implements a secure RFID-based door access control system using Arduino UNO and the MFRC522 RFID module. It verifies authorized RFID cards and controls a door lock, LED indicators, and buzzer for real-time feedback. The system also includes a manual push button to simulate emergency access or door override.
